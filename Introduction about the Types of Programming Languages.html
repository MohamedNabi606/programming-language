There are different types of programming languages, and these different types can be divided according to the criterion of their proximity to the human language or the language of the machine, in terms of the vocabulary used in it and the basic rules used in its formulation. Programming languages are divided according to this standard into two types as follows:
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Languages closer to machine language</li>
<li>Languages closer to the human language</li>
</ul>
On the other hand , programming languages can be divided into different types according to other criteria, such as dividing them according to the purposes or goals for which they were designed, Or divide them according to the privacy of the devices you work on and so on. The following are the details of these divisions:
<p><b>Levels of programming languages</b></p>
<p/>Given the division of types of programming languages according to the criterion of their closeness to human pleasure, the division of types of languages according to this standard into two types has been termed as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-level programming languages</li>
<p> It is languages close to the machine language and are understood only by specialists, and examples of them are Assembly Language</p>
<li>High-level programming languages are close to the language human beings understand, and Pascal is an example</li>
<p>It is close to the language human beings understand, and Pascal is an example</p>
</ul>
<b>Objectives of programming languages</b>
<p>Programming languages can be divided according to the purposes or goals for which the language was designed. Such as splitting them into:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Database programming languages</li>
<li>Android application programming languages</li>
<li> Web page programming languages </li>
<li>Programming languages and web site design</li> 
<li>programming languages and game development</li> 
</ul>
