The languages used in programming are in constant development according to the development of computers. In the beginnings of the emergence of the computer in the forties of the last century, the computer was operating in large numbers of electronic valves, and the languages used in programming were also complex and closer to the language of the machine, where the series of numbers in the binary counting system was used and written in the form of long programming codes from and the programming was then Difficult operation for programmers. But with the transistor invented the small size of the computer and increased its capabilities, specialists and programmers at the same time were able to create programming languages closer to human languages and easier to use, and the languages used in programming became very understandable to specialized programmers. And the development process continues in different languages.
