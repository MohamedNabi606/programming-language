Each of the languages has its own characteristics that distinguish it from other languages and make it suitable to varying degrees for each type of program and the tasks required of this program. But there are common features and limits between all programming languages by virtue of that all these languages are specially designed to deal with the computer or the computer regardless of The programming language is essentially evidence intended for the programmer to use in writing his program in the form of instructions and orders that the computer understands for the purpose of carrying out the work required, then the computer converts the language in which the programming is written into a series of numbers that he understands in the binary counting system (0. 1) , And on the basis of which it begins its work, and the chosen programming language provides a set of basic matters to draw upon during the process of creating the program and a set of Syntax rules that enable you to deal with data and organize it by displaying the required work performance. These principles and rules are generally centered around each of the following distinct characteristics
<ul>
<li>Information And storing it</li>
<li>Orders and organizing their conduct</li>
<li>Design for programming language </li>
</ul>
