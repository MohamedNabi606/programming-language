<p>Programming is the process by which a programmer writes a code, which is represented by a set of commands, which in turn are executed on computer devices. A programming language is a special language that is used by programmers to write programs, scripts, or another set of commands, to be executed on a computer<p/>
<p>Programming languages are a set of commands and instructions that are written according to specific rules according to each programming language, and then these commands go through several stages until they are executed from the computer. But the computer, like any electrical device, only understands the language of the machine that It adopts a binary counting system (0, 1) corresponding to two states (shutdown) that express the shutdown or operation of the machine by a person. The computer does not understand any other human languages, and therefore the need arose to invent and develop languages that the computer could understand. Languages The name of programming languages, which facilitate communicating with the computer and directing instructions and instructions to it to implement in the same way that we deal with it when it is turned on or off.<p/>
<p>Programming can be defined as the process of writing instructions and commands to a computer or any other electronic device, in order to direct it and inform it of how to carry out a series of required tasks or how to deal with data. Like human languages that have rules that must be followed when writing in any of them, one of the languages used in Programming also has special rules Syntax that the programmer must adhere to when programming with them and writing instructions and commands directed to the computer. He notes that when the programmer violates any of these rules, he appears to have a message stating that there is an error in the rules that govern the programming language used in a brief expression is Syntax Error<p/>
