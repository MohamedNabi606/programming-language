<ol>
<li><b>python</b></li>
<p> Python was developed at CWI in the Netherlands in the late 1980s and first published to the public in 1991.</p>
<P>Python is an advanced language of programming that is interpreted, object-oriented and based on flexible and robust semantics</p>
<p> Python is considered to be detailed and can very well be used for various purposes. In the field of machine learning, this programming language contains libraries such as numpy and scipy, which enable your PC to learn linear algebra and kernel methods for machine learning. While dealing with machine learning algorithms, this language is widely used as it has a simple structure. It is the best amateur programming language</p>
<img src=" Java_logo_small-e1458850657277-147x150.png" alt="Java">
<li><b>Java</b></li>
<P>Originally known as Oak, Java was developed in 1990 at Sun Microsystems to add capabilities to the C++ language</p>
<P>Java was based on the theory of WORA (Writing Once Run Anywhere). The language was published to the public in 1995, and is now owned by Oracle. Java is a high-level, object-oriented, general purpose programming language with numerous features making it suitable for web-based development</p>
<P>Java is the most widely used programming language around the world, so it's one of the best options for machine learning. In this language, in addition to the “Scala” language, the “Grin” framework is a comprehensive way to complete machine learning, NLP, linear algebra and the visualization framework. The H20 is also an open-source machine learning system that is quick and integrated for smarter applications such as deep learning,gradient enhancement, generalized linear modeling, and flexible grid.</p>
<img src=" HTML5_logo-e1458852233788.png" alt="html">
<li><b>HTML</b></li>
<P> In 1990, the physicist Tim Berners-Lee developed HTML to allow scientists to exchange papers online. Any contact before that was sent using plain text. HTML made “rich” text possible (i.e. text formatting and visual images).</p>
<P>HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages; it ensures that text and images (using tags) are properly formatted so that Internet browsers can display them in the way they were intended to look.</p>
<img src=" js_logo-150x150.jpg" alt="Java script">
<li><b>Java script</b></li>
<P>JavaScript was originally developed by Netscape and known as LiveScript, before becoming JavaScript in 1995. JavaScript is a programming language on the client side that runs inside a web application, executing commands on a computer rather than a server. It is typically put inside an HTML or ASP file. JavaScript is not related to Java, in spite of its name</p>
<P>Currently most web developers, new or former, use JavaScript, this language has long been restricted in web development, but at this point, with Tensorflow.js, an open source library for Google’s machine learning system, it is now possible to use the language In machine learning.</p>
<img src=" The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg-e1458850872533-150x150.png" alt="c">
<li><b>C</b></li>
<P>The C language was specifically developed at Bell Labs in 1972 for the implementation of the UNIX system. It eventually gave rise to many advanced programming languages, including C++, Java C#, JavaScript and Pearl.</p>
<P>C Language is a structure-oriented, middle-level programming language mostly used to develop low-level applications</p>
<P>This language is used for machine learning algorithms because of its high speed in code implementation. And the practical use of C ++ can help in using this language to build machine learning algorithms. Among the languages supported by Google's open source machine learning library, Tensorflow, is language C.</p>
<img src=" cplusplus-e1458851875453.png" alt="c++">
<li><b>C++</b></li>
<P>Released in 1983 and often considered an object-oriented version of C language, C++ was created to compile lean, efficient code, while providing high-level abstractions to better manage large development projects</p>
<P>C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a “C style”. In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language.</p>
<img src=" csharp-e1458852305738.png" alt="c#">
<li><b>C#</b></li>
<P> C # was developed as part of the introduction of Microsoft's .NET platform in 2000; it became an ISO standard in 2003. C # was based on C , C++ and Java languages Pronounced C-sharp (not C-hashtag), C # is a multiparadigm programming language with fast typing, imperative, declarative, procedural, generic, object-oriented and component-oriented disciplines.</p>
<P>Data science is closely related to machine learning. If you are from the .NET and C # organization, you may want to use C # for machine learning.</p>
<img src=" PHP_logo-e1458852426817.png" alt="php">
<li><b>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)</b></li>
<P>In 1995 PHP was released as a server-side scripting language which is processed on a server to become a plain HTML website</p>
<P>PHP is an open source scripting language designed to build interactive web pages that interact with databases in an efficient manner. It is also used as a language for general purpose programming.</p>
<img src=" SQL-e1458852050512.png" alt="sql">
<li><b>SQL (Structured Query Language)</b></li>
<P>In 1974, SQL was developed at the IBM Research Center and initially known as SEQUEL</p>
<P> ORACLE SQL released the first commercial version in 1979, which is a database query language (not a development language) that allows information to be added, accessed, and managed in a database</p>
<P>It is the language that allows programmers to perform the common acronym CRUD inside a database (Create; Read; Update; Delete).</p>
<img src=" Swift_logo.svg-e1458852469126.png" alt="swift">
<li><b>Swift</b></li>
<P> Swift, which is based on the programming language Objective-C, was introduced at the 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in Apple.The most recent version, Swift 2, was released in 2015 as an open-source language</p> 
<P>Swift incorporates the named parameters and object-oriented model of Objective-C, while integrating an advanced parser, debugger, and application infrastructure.</p> 
<P>Swift is the newest open-source, multi-paradigm programming language for Apple's iOS and OS X applications</p>
